Duplo
=====

Duplo is a tool for dumping the ROM in some Game Boy Advance Video cartridges. It cannot dump any other type of cartridge. These use an undocumented mapper by Matrix Memory that has been partially reverse engineered for the purposes of this project. In the future, it may be possible to do more with this mapper.
